// Simple javascript code
//The console.log() function is commonly used for debugging and logging information during development.
//The console.log() statements are used to print the values of these variables to the console.
console.log("hello, world!")

// Log the values of the variables to the console
console.log("Number Variable:", 17);
console.log("String Variable:", Hennesse);
console.log("Boolean Variable:", true);

// Declare variables with different data types
//  Variables declared with var are function-scoped, This means they are only available within the function where they are declared. 
var numberVar = 42;         // Number
var stringVar = "Hello";    // String
var booleanVar = true;      // Boolean

// Variables declared with let are block-scoped, This means they are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. 
// Variable declaration and initialization
let numberVar = 42; // Number
let stringVar = "Hello, World!"; // String
let booleanVar = true; // Boolean
