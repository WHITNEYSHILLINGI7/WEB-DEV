        <u>Love never fails</u>
 Love is patient, Love is kind
Through Jesus Christ, love you will find.
Love does not envy, It is not puffed up
Seek Him with your heart, He will fill your cup.

Love does not behave rudely, does not seek its own
Be kind to others, for this God has shown.
Love bears, believes, hopes and endures all things,
Give love to all and blessings God brings.

<p><strong>Love Never Fails.

Words to Say I Love You
I was there, yet you did not see Me
the times you did cry
I wrapped you in My loving arms
and wiped the tears from your eyes.

Every prayer – I heard, and answered
every cry for help – I came
I cast down all your enemies
and brought them all to shame.

You are My beloved son
whom I have set free
I removed your chains of darkness
because you believed in Me.

I am in you and you in Me
Non can take us apart
Where are the words to express my love?
They are written on your heart.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do Everything In Love
In everything you do,
Do it in love
For the Father is watching
In Heaven above.

At work or at play
Offer words of kindness to others
To the cashier, the barber
The bus driver and new mothers.

Jesus is the example
That we all should follow
Love is the ultimate gift
To give those in good times and sorrow.
